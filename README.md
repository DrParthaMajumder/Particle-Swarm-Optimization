# Short Note on Particle Swarm Optimization:
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the social behavior of bird flocking or fish schooling. In PSO, a population of particles moves through a problem space, searching for the optimal solution. Each particle adjusts its position based on its own best known position and the best known position of its neighboring particles. This collaborative behavior allows the particles to effectively explore the search space and converge towards the global optimum. PSO is widely used for solving optimization problems in various fields due to its simplicity, efficiency, and ability to handle both continuous and discrete variables.
